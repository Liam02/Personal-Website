        <div class="item">
          <h3>Transpose Cord App</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/Liam02/Transpose-Cord-App">
            <img src="./img/project-1.jpg" alt="project">
          </a>
          <p>This is an app that takes a song name and returns all the cords for each lyric. The cords can be transposed up or down.</p>
          <p>Click on the image to get the github repository and follow the README instructions to run this app.</p>

          </a>
          <p>This is a fitness app utilising a database to store, manipulate, and get data. It was made in a team effort with 2 other of my colleagues.</p>
          <p>Click on the image to get the github repository and follow the README instructions to run this app.</p>
          <p>Also, I highly recommend watching the youtube video attached in the github repository to understand the app better.</p>

          <h3>Example Trading Strategy using Renko bars for TradingView</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/Liam02/Example-Trading-Strategy-using-Renko-bars-for-TradingView">
            <img src="./img/project-5.jpg" alt="project">
          </a>
          <p>This is an example trading strategy I've made on the charting/trading platform "TradingView". The strategy can actually be made into a trading bot if you use the automated trading platform "TradersPost". TradersPost connects the TradingView platform with your broker to make trading automated. The proscess goes somewhat like this; TradingView sends a post request to TradersPost, TradersPost receives the request and decides what signal to send to your broker, Sell, Buy, Exit, etc, then your broker receives the signal and follows the instructions on what to do.</p>
          <p>Click on the image to get the github repository.</p>
          <p>Note: I have a lot of trading strategies and indicators that I've made on Trading View, but I wouldn't show them here because I use them currently to make my own profitable strategies.</p>
          <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/u/Darkoexe/#published-scripts">
            <p>However, I do post indicators or strategies that I don't need publicly on my Trading View profile if you would like to see them. Just click here.</p>

          <h3>Elevator System Simulator using Qt C++</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/Liam02/-Elevator-System-Simulator-in-Qt">
            <img src="./img/project-6.jpg" alt="project">
          </a>
          <p>This is an Elevator system simulator that uses the QT framework. It can do about anything a typical elevator would do including safety features like fire emergencies and a power outage.</p>
          <p>Made use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and state machine diagrams to help conceptualize the design for the code.</p>
          <p>Click on the image to get the github repository.</p>
          <p>Also, I highly recommend watching the youtube video attached in the github repository to understand the app better.</p>

          <h3>Health Device Simulator using Qt C++</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/Liam02/Radotech_Device_Final">
            <img src="./img/project-7.jpg" alt="project">
          </a>
          <p>This is a health device simulator, specifically the Radotech Health device. Essentially, the device can scan a users health metrics to help a user identify what they need to work on to improve there health. The health metrics are saved on every scan so a user can go back and look at their previous metrics to see their progress.</p>
          <p>I collaborated with 4 other colleagues to make this device simulator. Our task were to make use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, state machine diagrams, then complete the code using our diagrams as reference.</p>
          <p>Click on the image to get the github repository.</p>
          <p>Also, I highly recommend watching the youtube video attached in the github repository to understand the device better.</p>
